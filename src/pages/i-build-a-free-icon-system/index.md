It's a little annoying and time-consuming when I searching for icons as the style of the icons can be different and can cost you quite a lot of time to tweak. Actually, there's a good and open-sourced icon system out there called [Remix Icon](https://remixicon.com/). So why I created another one? Only god knows.

## Design

A picture is worth a thousand words.

## Coding

This is the first time I use [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) to build a web application. If you haven't used or even never heard of it, I strongly recommend you to give it a try. Since the syntax of **Elm** is quite different from normal JavaScript's, you should follow the [Official Guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org/) step by step to boost up your development.

**JavaScript Hub** is built upon a small framework called [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.de), which is based on [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). If you haven't heard of **Svelte**, I recommend you to have a glance at [Rich Harris - Rethinking reactivity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdNJ3fydeao).

The main idea is to establish a **true-or-false** selection panel with statistics, explanation and data storage. For the codes, you can find the whole project on [GitHub](https://github.com/DezineLeo/javascript-hub). Here is a list of prerequisites to get you started.

+ HTML, CSS and JS, as always.
+ [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) for the syntax.
+ [Prism](https://prismjs.com/) for syntax hignlight.
