It's a little annoying and time-consuming when I searching for icons as the style of the icons can be different and can cost you quite a lot of time to tweak. Actually, there's a good and open-sourced icon system out there called [Remix Icon](https://remixicon.com/). So why I created another one? Only god knows.
