As a self-taught web developer, I can always deliver coding stuff, even if I don't know the essence. Yes, Google it or StackOverflow it when I'm trapped. However, I could have made better stuff if I mastered more coding skills. So I've tried to dive deep into the JavaScript through courses and still in progress. I build **JavaScript Hub** to not only help JS newbies but also try to build a mind map for myself.

## Design

A picture is worth a thousand words.

## Coding

**JavaScript Hub** is built upon a small framework called [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.de), which is based on [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). If you haven't heard of **Svelte**, I recommend you to have a glance at [Rich Harris - Rethinking reactivity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdNJ3fydeao).

The main idea is to establish a **true-or-false** selection panel with statistics, explanation and data storage. For the codes, you can find the whole project on [GitHub](https://github.com/DezineLeo/javascript-hub). Here is a list of prerequisites to get you started.

+ HTML, CSS and JS, as always.
+ [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) for the syntax.
+ [Prism](https://prismjs.com/) for syntax hignlight.


## Features

+ Constantly updates.
+ Export current questions as a `.json` file.
+ Import your own JSON files.
