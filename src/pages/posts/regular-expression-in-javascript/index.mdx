import Code from '@components/Code'
import MatchEmailCode from './codes/matchEmail.example'

<Code lang="js" code={MatchEmailCode} />

Have you ever seen this kind of expression before? When I first saw that, WTF is this cryptic syntax. I was scared and refused to touch it. However, When I finally decided to make the plunge and learn what **RegExp** was all about, I was surprised at how simple the basic concepts were to learn.

## What are Regular Expressions?
**Regular expressions** are patterns used to match character combinations **in strings**. Properly understanding regular expressions will make you a better coder.

> In JavaScript, regular expressions are also objects.

## Write your first RegExp

In addition to Chrome console, you can also test the regex code in [Regex101](https://regex101.com/).

import FirstRegEx from './codes/firstRegex.example'

<Code lang="js" code={FirstRegEx} />

As you can see, we've used *match* method to output an array. We can also use *test* to return a boolean.

## Challenges

Now let's do some challenges.

### Challenge 01 - Characters only

import ChallengeOne from './codes/challengeOne.example'

<Code lang="js" code={ChallengeOne} hl={['5-6']} />

Don't worry, I'll explain the code piece by piece. As you can see above, there're some special characters like `^[a-zA-Z]+$`:

+ `^…$` -	Starts and ends
+ `+`	- One or more repetitions
+ `[a-zA-z]` - Match all characters

You can check the whole list of **special characters** in [Using Special Characters | MDN](http://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions#Using_special_characters).

Note: if you run the code twice, you'll find different output. That's because when you're using */g*, the regex object will save state between calls (since you should be using it to match over multiple calls). It matches once, but subsequent calls start from after the original match.

### Challenge 02 - Numbers only

import ChallengeTwo from './codes/challengeTwo.example'

<Code lang="js" code={ChallengeTwo} />

As you can see above, I added a `+` sign after `\d`. That indicates the digit number may be repeated more than once.

### Challenge 03 - Six alphanumeric characters only

Use braces to indicate that a pattern should occur a precise number of times.

import ChallengeThree from './codes/challengeThree.example'

<Code lang="js" code={ChallengeThree} />

Step a little bit further.

import ChallengeThreeExtend from './codes/challengeThreeExtend.example'

<Code lang="js" code={ChallengeThreeExtend} />

### Challenge 04 - Match phone number

import ChallengeFour from './codes/challengeFour.example'

<Code lang="js" code={ChallengeFour} />

Now the challenge is upgraded, please use RegExp to output the last 8 numbers in a phone number and replace them with \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*.

import ChallengeFourExtend from './codes/challengeFourExtend.example'

<Code lang="js" code={ChallengeFourExtend} />

### Challenge 05 - Match Email address & date format

import ChallengeFive from './codes/challengeFive.example'

<Code lang="js" code={ChallengeFive} />

The question mark makes the *-* sign optional, meaning it may occur zero time or one time.

import ChallengeFiveExtend from './codes/challengeFiveExtend.example'

<Code lang="js" code={ChallengeFiveExtend} />

### Challenge 06 - Test root URL & get URL parameters

import ChallengeSix from './codes/challengeSix.example'

<Code lang="js" code={ChallengeSix} />

Note: as a general rule, if your regular expression will remain constant, i.e. your expression will change, it is best to use a regex literal. If your regular expression will change, or rely on other variables, it is better to use the constructor method.

import ChallengeSixExtend from './codes/challengeSixExtend.example'

<Code lang="js" code={ChallengeSixExtend} />

## Conclusion

Regular expression is not that big thing, just keep in mind, **no rules, no RegExp**. Also, you need to memorize the common groups and symbols.
