It's a little annoying and time-consuming when I searching for icons as the style of the icons can be different and can cost you quite a lot of time to tweak. Actually, there's a good and open-sourced icon system out there called [Remix Icon](https://remixicon.com/). So why I created another one? Only god knows.

## Coding

This is the first time I use [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) to build a web application. If you haven't used or even never heard of it, I strongly recommend you to give it a try. Since the syntax of **Elm** is quite different from normal JavaScript's, you should follow the [Official Guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org/) step by step to boost up your development.
