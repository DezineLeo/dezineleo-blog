## What is Puppeteer

[Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) is a **Node library** which provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Chromium over the DevTools Protocol. It means you can do almost everything done manually in the browser like screencast, submission, UI testing, performance diagnosis and even crawling popular SPAs.

## Why not Python?

Until when I know how to use Python. I've listed Python in my [Programming Challenge](/programming-challenge), you should definitely keep an eye on that later.

## Play #1 - Download all the courses in Frontend Masters

Today is the Teachers Day in China, as an ex-teacher, I've just subscrible to [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/) as a monthly member which costs $39 per month. Indeed, it's a little expensive as I can use that amount of money to pay for the yearly member of Netease Cloud Music for almost two years. So I need to do something to balance my mind.

Obviously, it's impossible to finish all the courses listed on the platform just in one month. So I should figure out a way to download all the courses and **puppeteer** comes to my mind.

I didn't see any cookies or unique code sent to server to identify my authority. Maybe it's too fast for me to even notice the redirection invoked by the server. So I needed to login to grab the source link of the target video. I use the **download** package to download the source while the speed is quite a disappointment.

Oops, my account has been suspended for scripting downloads against their web player APIs. ðŸ¤« I'll come back later.
