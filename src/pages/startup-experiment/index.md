Inspired by a guy called [timqian](https://github.com/timqian) who throws out a good idea about freelancing which reminds me of another guy called [Pat Flynn](https://twitter.com/patflynn) who is famous of [Monthly Income Reports](https://www.smartpassiveincome.com/income-reports/), I decided to start my own startup experiment. As a seasoned website designer and developer, I wanna test out what kind of profit I can make in my spare time.

## What I'm targeting

+ 10K dollars passive income per month

## What I have

+ 1 year
+ An early-2015 13' Mackbook Pro
+ A couple of accounts to sell my stuff
+ Personal website
+ A full-stack website designer and developer

## What I'm going to share

+ Income reports
+ Free stuff
+ My ideology

## Where to find me
