Back in the day, I knew nothing about JS, not even HTML/CSS, I could just build a website using site generators like Weebly and WordPress. I spent countless hours to tweak the CSS. Then I went into jQuery which is the most popular library at that moment. By combing tons of jQuery plugins, I could achieve fancy stuff like infinite scrolling.

A couple years later, after I've design and developed more than 100 websites, I chose to dig deep into the programming stuff like WTF is going on under the hood. To be honest, I just wanted to feel more like a "real developer". So I started to learn Vanilla JS, yes, ES6 was ready to go at that time. Also, browserâ€™s were finally standardizing features and implementations, so cross-browser compatibility was a lot easier than it had been in the past.

Stay tuned, this topic is not closed...
