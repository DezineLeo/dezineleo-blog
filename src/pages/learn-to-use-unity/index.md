Thanks to COVID-19, I get three-month access to [Unity Learn Premium](https://learn.unity.com/).

I'm working for an AR company right now and a lot of the AR stuff is done by Unity, though I'm in charge of the web AR, I'm still wanna take a look at how Unity works as I think it might helps to build a comprehensive understanding of the AR as well as the mobile game industry.

**TL;DR**

Since I don't know how many courses I can accomplish in just 3 months, this post might be long and not that fun to read, but I'll try my best to list the points as well as my thinking.

I took the lesson of [Beginner Design: Unity Game Development Course](https://learn.unity.com/course/beginner-design-unity-game-development-course?language=en) firstly.

## Beginner Design: Unity Game Development Course
