## What is BEM?

BEM is one of the methodologies to maintain large scale CSS with efficiency. Below is a list of other methodologies out there.

+ [OOCSS](http://oocss.org/)
+ [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/)
+ [SUITCSS](http://suitcss.github.io/)
+ [Atomic](http://github.com/nemophrost/atomic-css)

BEM stands for <span class="hl-1">Block</span>, <span class="hl-2">Element</span>, <span class="hl-3">Modifier</span>, and that's what makes the magic happen.

## Block, Element and Modifier

+ **Block** - Standalone entity like `header`, `container` and `menu`, which is meaningful on its own.
+ **Element** - No standalone meaning but semantically tied to its block like `menu item`.
+ **Modifier** - A flag on a block or element to change appearance or behavior like `disabled`.
